# Rapid Backup to Zip

You can use this program to create ZIP file (compressed) snapshots of an entire folder.

You can keep different versions and the filename increments each time it's made.  

--------------------------------

EXAMPLE:  hack_pybook_1.zip, hack_pybook_2.zip ... hack_pybook_n.zip

--------------------------------

The whole point is to automate a very repetitive, dull task.
